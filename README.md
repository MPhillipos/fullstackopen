# Full Stack Open

Welcome to my Full Stack Open repository! This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and projects from the Full Stack Open course offered by the University of Helsinki.


## Course Overview

Full Stack Open is a free online course that teaches modern web development practices. The course covers a wide range of topics, including JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and GraphQL. Each module includes video lectures and exercises, and there are several larger projects throughout the course to apply the skills learned.
